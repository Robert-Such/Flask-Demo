https://hackersandslackers.com/series/build-flask-apps/
 - Modifications have been made to allow this project to run via a docker-compose setup.
 - Docker-compose is set to deploy containers for FLASK, MYSQL, and REDIS however the MYSQL
   container takes the longest to spin up.  A simple restart of the Flask container should resolve
   any issues with rejected requests to the MYSQL.
 - Screenshots of output for the various tasks are available in the screenshots folder.
